# Satisfactory Mods Collection

A collection of mods I've developed (or I'm currently working on) for the game Satisfactory by Coffee Stain Studios.

All of the work contained within this repository is free to copy and reuse, but iit's appreciated if you notify me when doing so.

Feel free to post any issue you may have with my mods in here.

Keep in mind I am new to all of the Satisfactory modding stuff and UE5 (although I've tinkered with UE in the past and I consider myself fluent in coding) so be patient with me :3
